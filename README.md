## Examination for module 338005a Applied Analytics
### by alexander ciuffreda, matriculation number 37262 
## Use case overview
Three use cases for different ML methods are addressed in the context of the payment service provider PayPal.
### Regression
For regression we want to predict the amount a customer spends on a day.
### Clustering
In the clustering we want to divide our customers into certain groups
### Classification
The classification use case deals with detecting fraudulent transactions

## Dataset
Unfortunately there was no suitable single dataset for all three use cases, so i decided to take three different datasets.


## Notebooks
Each notebook is rendered as HTML and in the corresponding use case folder with the prefix ``nb_converted``.
## Randomized search

For some models i used a randomized search to estimate the best hyperparameters. Since this process took a while, all results are available as CSV files (and sometimes in addition excel files).
